However, often times in practice there are no clear guidelines on how to develop the best model for an application. Suppose we want to build a binary classifier with high recall and precision. How should we proceed if our off-the-shelf model performs poorly on the dataset?\n","\n","In this lab, we will explore a series of techniques for improving your model and features. We will cover seven techniques:\n","\n","- **Model selection**: Try different models to see what works best\n","- **Scaling**: The scale of the values in your data is important\n","- **Feature engineering**: If the existing features aren't useful then we can create new and more relevant features   \n","- **Feature selection**: If you have too many features then we can remove some that aren't useful\n","- **Grid Search**: A process for finding a set of good hyper-parameters (e.g., regularization strength)\n","- **Model stacking**: A process where the output from one or more models are input into another\n","- **Bagging**: A process for combining models that involves combining the outputs from multiple models\n","\n","Model engineering is more of an art than it is a science. These techniques will work better in some instances than they do in others, and sometimes these techniques can actually make a model perform worse! When you do model engineering it really boils does to doing trial-and-error with these techniques. It is possible to combine these techniques (e.g., do model selection, scaling, and grid search), however, to stop this lab from becoming convoluted you will only combine each technique with model selection.\n","\n","Please keep in mind that these are just a set of possible ways to improve our models. There are many ways to engineer better models, and often the practice of model engineering comes down to the application and our prior experience. We emphasize that in this lab these techniques are largely applied in isolation, but we encourage you to combine multiple techniques in your project."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"Ne5Do4xAIue5"},"source":["## Application\n","This lab will focus on the lending industry, where investors provide loans to borrowers in exchange for the promise of repayment with interest. If the borrower repays the loan, then the lender profits from the interest. However, sometimes the borrower is unable to repay the loan, meaning the lender loses money. The lender in this problem wants to predict if a borrower is unlikely to repay a loan and has asked us to build the best possible prediction model.\n","\n","First, let us import the essential

The easiest way to standardize data is with the `StandardScaler` function, which is \"fit\" (i.e., calculates the mean and standard deviation) on the training set. Once the `StandardScaler` is \"fit\", you should apply it to both the training and testing set before fitting and scoring your prediction model.

When this is the case, you should try to collect better data, however, when better data in unavailable we must do the best with what we have. One option is to create new, strong features that are more useful for predicting the target by transforming and combining weak features (like we did in Lab 1!). This practice is known as feature engineering.\n","\n","Generally, good features have several desirable characteristics, for example, they:\n","*   are spread out evenly (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions)\n","*   behave differently (e.g., they may have different means) when the target is different\n","*   are normalized to similar scales.\n","\n","One common technique is to apply logarithms or square roots to features with very large values that follow a distribution with a long tail (e.g., population, income). The problem with distributions that have large values and long tails is that the absolute change in the value of a feature gives less information than the relative change. For example, a 100 dollar difference in income means very different things if you are comparing two low income data points versus two high income data points.\n","\n","We can also \"combine\" features (e.g., add them, multiply them) to make them more useful. When we combine features we can take advantage of *interaction effects* (a concept from statistics), where the interaction of two features together is greater than the sum of the parts. For example, if two features correlate strongly with a target, it is likely that the product of the two features will also correlate. \n","\n","Constructing good features requires experience, domain expertise, and some luck. If you have domain knowledge about your application then you should  think about whether a transformation or a new feature makes sense for the problem, and you should always check that your engineered features are useful for predicting a target. You can generally do anything to create new features. The common tricks include multiplying and/or dividing multiple existing features, however, there are two major rules related to feature engineering:\n","\n","1. Do not create too many features, especially in order to chase marginal increases in correlation. If the correlation is small and your dataset is small, you might be creating fake (dataset-dependent) correlations that won't generalize outside of your training data.\n","2.

For example, logistic regression on scikit-learn allows 'L1' or 'L2' regularization, a regularization weight 'C', and additional modifications to the loss function (see [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for full list).

However, how do we tune 5 or 6 different parameters all at once? The standard method is known as _grid-searching_, where we simply do k-fold cross-validation on all possible combinations of the different parameter values. In grid searching, the practice is to define a specific scoring function, perform a search, and identify an appropriate model. Of course, this approach is computationally expensive, especially when there is a large number of parameters or values to consider. Interestingly, researchers have found that randomly searching the parameter space is often just as effective as grid searching. What this suggests is that there is often no good intuitive way to choose hyperparameters.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"JoE9YUcoORdu"},"source":["## Parameter tuning via grid search\n","\n","Scikit-learn provides two useful functions `GridSearchCV()` and `RandomSearchCV()` to implement two approaches towards selecting the hyperparameters.

You can add new components in the stack, grid search to find better parameters of the top model, hunt for new features, and train different models on different subsets of data (e.g., bagging/bootstrap).
