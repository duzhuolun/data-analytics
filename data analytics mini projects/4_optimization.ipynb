Instead of making predictions, you are prescribing a best course of action for a given decision-making problem. \n","\n","An optimization problem is described by a vector $\\bf{x}$ modeling decision variables, an objective function $f(\\bf{x})$ to optimize, and a feasible set $\\mathcal{X}$ for which $\\bf{x}$ must belong to, i.e., $\\bf{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}$. The optimization problem is:\n","\n","1. A linear program (LP) when $\\bf{x}$ is made up of continuous variables, $\\mathcal{X}$ is made up of linear constraints, and the objective function is linear in $\\bf{x}$, i.e., $f(\\bf{x}) = \\bf{c}^\\top \\bf{x}$. \n","\n","2. An integer program (IP) if $\\bf{x}$ includes integer variables. \n","\n","3. A quadratic program (QP) if the objective function $f(\\bf{x})$ is quadratic in $\\bf{x}$, i.e., $f(\\bf{x}) = \\bf{x}^\\top\\bf{Q} \\bf{x}$ (where $\\bf{Q}$ is a real symmetric matrix).\n","\n","LPs are easy to solve, and can be solved in polynomial time. On the other hand, IPs are generally difficult to solve, and are $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems. QPs are somewhere in between, some are easy to solve and some are hard to solve. You have already been solving QPs in this course! The least squares method (from linear and logistic regression) is a QP, since you are minimizing the *squared* residual errors.\n","\n","\n","To begin this lab, let us first import the essential tools. We will be using a solver called CVXPY to solve all our optimization problems. If you would like more practice, or would like to see how cvxpy can be used to solve more complicated optimization problems than those presented in this lab, please visit the [website](https://www.cvxpy.org/) where there are lots of resources and example codes. There are many other open-source solvers and packages available (e.g., [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/overview), [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/)) that are more powerful than CVXPY, however, CVXPY has more friendly syntax.

The general idea is as follows. You have a knapsack with some capacity and you want to put a set of items into it. You generally cannot fit all of the items into the knapsack, so you have to decide which items to pick. Each item has a weight and a value, and you want to find the subset of items of maximum total value such that its total weight does not exceed the capacity. The knapsack problem is an integer programming problem because the variables take on binary values; you either pick an item or you don't. Mathematically, the knapsack problem is as follows:\n","\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","        \\max_{\\bf{x}} \\quad    & \\sum_{j=1}^n v_j x_j \\\\\n","        s.t. \\quad           & \\sum_{j=1}^n w_{j} x_j \\leq C \\\\\n","\t\t\\quad & x_j \\in \\{0,1\\},  \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}.\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","In the above formulation $v_j$ represents the value of item $j$, $x_j$ is our decision variable representing whether or not we put item $j$ in the knapsack, $w_j$ is the weight of item $j$, and $C$ is the capacity of our knapsack. The first constraint ensures the total weight of our items does not exceed the knapsack, and it is called a *knapsack constraint*. \n","\n","In certain problems, we may want to consider *fractional knapsack problems*, which is simply the formulation above without the integrality constraints, i.e., the vector $\\bf{x}$ is continuous and can include any values between 0 and 1. The fractional knapsack problem is an LP, whereas the general knapsack problem is an IP. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BbYNRtUO-0eN"},"source":["##Application\n","\n","Many problems can be formulated as knapsack problems.

Risk is defined by the variance of the portfolio. The higher the variance, the more likely you are to lose a lot of money.

The risk is given by the term ${\\bf{x}}^\\top \\Sigma {\\bf{x}}$, where $\\Sigma$ denotes the covariance matrix of the stocks.

While you will not be expected to understand the math in detail, it should serve to give a better idea of portfolio optimization for those who are interested. \n","\n","First, we discuss the topic of *expected* return. If we buy a stock at price $p_i$ and sell it at $p^*_i$ in the next period, we will make a return of $r_i = (p^*_i - p_i)/p_i$. At the time of buying stocks, however, we will not know exactly what the return of each stock will be. Nonetheless, we can estimate the *expected return* $\\mathbb{E}[r_i]$, which is denoted by $\\mu_i$.

If we write out $\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\Sigma \\mathbf{x}$, we get $\\sum _{i}x_{i}^{2}\\sigma _{i}^{2}+\\sum _{i}\\sum _{j\\neq i}x_{i}x_{j}\\sigma _{i}\\sigma _{j}\\rho _{ij}$, where $\\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation of a stock $i$ and $\\rho_{ij}$ is the correlation coefficient between stock $i$ and $j$.
