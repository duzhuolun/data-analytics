Lets do a quick review on *adjusted plus/minus*, a metric frequently used in sports statistics. "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4o8GuIezBrdk"},"source":["# Adjusted Plus/Minus (APM)\n","\n","\n"," We begin with some important terms to know to help understand (APM):\n","\n","*   **Stint**: A stint is a period of time with the same players on the court (i.e., no substitutions are made and no end of quarter break is present within the stint). \n","*   **Plus-Minus (+/-)**: The score differential for a player when they are on the court, typically normalized by playing time or possessions. This can be calculated across any window of time (e.g. quarters, games, seasons, etc.).  For our purposes, we calculate plus-minus at the stint level and normalize by minutes.  A major limitation of this statistic is that it does not account for the quality of the other players on the court during the stint.\n","\n","Here we provide an illustrative example of raw plus-minus. Consider a mini-version of wheelchair rugby where each team has three players and only two are allowed on the court at any one time. We will identify the players as A1, A2, and A3 for Team A (home team), and B1, B2,and B3 for Team B (away team). Consider the following five stints:\n","\n","1.   A1, A2, vs. B1, B2 resulted in a score of 11-5 over 4 minutes\n","2.   A1, A3, vs. B2, B3 resulted in a score of 4-9 over 5 minutes\n","3.   A2, A3, vs. B1, B3 resulted in a score of 8-10 over 4 minutes\n","4.   A2, A3, vs. B2, B3 resulted in a score of 3-1 over 2 minutes\n","5.   A1, A3, vs. B1, B3 resulted in a score of 7-8 over 5 minutes\n","\n","Let's consider the raw plus-minus for player A2. The first time A2 was on the court, stint 1, the normalized plus-minus was $6/4$, or 1.5. The second time was in stint 3, in which the normalized plus-minus was $-0.5$. The last time was in stint 4, where the normalized plus-minus was $1.0$. Overall, A2's plus-minus per minute would be 2. Was A2 really the driving factor in Team A earning a $+2$ score differential over the ten minutes A2 played? Or did A2 just happen to be on the court when the other players on Team A were the real contributors? \n","\n","The intuition behind adjusted plus-minus is to \"adjust\", or \"correct\", or \"distributed\" a player's raw plus-minus value based on the additional information of who they played with, as given by their collection of stints. One way to operationalize this adjustment is via a linear regression model.\n","    \n","The target (i.e., response variable), denoted $y_i$, is the score differential between the home team and the away team during stint $i$, normalized by the number of minutes in that stint. This is the raw plus-minus value of that stint (not of the player). The features (i.e., dependent variables), denoted $X_{ij}$, indicate whether player $j$ is on the court during stint $i$, constructed to differentiate home players from away players. Specifically:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","X_{ij} = \\begin{cases} \n","    1,  &\\text{if player } j \\text{ is on-court for the home team during stint } i \\\\\n","    -1,  &\\text{if player } j \\text{ is on-court for the away team during stint } i\\\\\n","    0,  &\\text{otherwise.} \n","\\end{cases}\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","Putting this together in a linear model, we have\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","    y_{i} &= \\sum_{j=1}^6 \\beta_{j} X_{ij} + \\epsilon_i \n","\\end{align} \n","\n","where the residual, denoted $\\epsilon_i$, is assumed to follow a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance $\\sigma^2$.  Plugging in the data from the stints above into this model, we have:  \n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","1.5 = \\beta_{A1} + \\beta_{A2} - \\beta_{B1} - \\beta_{B2}  + \\epsilon_1 \\\\\n","-1 = \\beta_{A1} + \\beta_{A3} - \\beta_{B2} - \\beta_{B3} + \\epsilon_2 \\\\\n","-0.5 = \\beta_{A2} + \\beta_{A3} - \\beta_{B1} -  \\beta_{B3} + \\epsilon_3 \\\\\n","1 = \\beta_{A2} + \\beta_{A3} - \\beta_{B2} -  \\beta_{B3} + \\epsilon_4 \\\\\n","-0.2 = \\beta_{A2} + \\beta_{A3} - \\beta_{B1} -  \\beta_{B3} + \\epsilon_5\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","With a few more stints, this model could be fit using least squares (other estimators could also be used). However, note that having knowledge of whether any two players from a team are on the court fully determines whether the third player on that team is on the court (leading to multicollinearity).

Its important to understand how the results of this model will be utilized, namely, it will tell us how many total minutes each player should play. This doesn't tell us anything about what lineup they should be on or when they should be on the court. We leave it up to the coach to design their lineups while adhering to this maximum time limit that this model will recommend. \n","\n","This model will be a bit more complicated, so take your time understanding each of the following pieces. We skip certain details of this formulation in the main body of the lab, but the full discussion is found in the appendix. It is highly recommended that you read the appendix information, as this will make the following content easier to understand.\n","\n","The following function (derived fully in the appendix), $C(t)$, represents how much value, or $APM$, a player will achieve by playing for a total time $t$. \n","\n","Its important to notice the decreasing slope as the time $t$ increases. This can intuitively be understood that as a player begins to fatigue, their ability to earn value per minute of playing time is decreasing. \n","\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","  C(t) =\n","  \\begin{cases}\n","          \\beta t  && 0 \\leq t < 6 \\\\\n","          0.75\\beta t + 1.5\\beta  && 6 \\leq t < 12 \\\\\n","          0.50\\beta t + 4.5\\beta && 12 \\leq t < 24 \\\\\n","          0.25\\beta t + 10.5\\beta  && 24 \\leq t \\leq 32 \\\\\n","  \\end{cases}\n","\\end{aligned}\n","\n","We can plot this piece-wise function, $C(t)$, below. Note that the bolded sections of the plot is what we are most concerned with, as these sections are where each $y = mt + b$ line falls under its appropriate interval. \n","\n","<figure>\n","<img src=\"https://docs.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1izWlZtip_51Q6PBhufB1sdaWQKEMEQ_W\"\n","alt=\"\" />\n","<figcaption>Relationship between Cumulative APM and Playing Time with a $\\beta = 12$.</figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","Note, this function takes the form of a **concave** piece-wise linear function due to its concavity.

In our case, $k=4$. Also noting that the $m$'s and the $b$'s are the slopes and intercepts of each line segment.\n","\n","Why is it a minimum over each segment? Lets take a look at what $C(t=3)$ would be. Looking at the grey dotted line in the graph above, this line intersects each of the 4 line segments at different $y$ values. However, for the interval of $[0,6]$, we should only look at the red, bolded segment. By choosing the minumum of these 4 intersection points, we're gauranteed to stay on the correct segment for each $t$, depending on which interval $t$ lies on! \n","\n","We run into an issue with the players who have a negative $\\beta$. For this, we define the following concave piece-wise function to model how their APM gets more negative, i.e., *worse* over time (more discussion on this in the appendix):\n","\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","  D(t) =\n","  \\begin{cases}\n","          \\beta t  && 0 \\leq t < 6 \\\\\n","          1.25\\beta t - 1.5\\beta  && 6 \\leq t < 12 \\\\\n","          1.50\\beta t - 4.5\\beta && 12 \\leq t < 24 \\\\\n","          1.75\\beta t - 10.5\\beta  && 24 \\leq t \\leq 32 \\\\\n","  \\end{cases}\n","\\end{aligned}\n","\n","These functions are also concave, so we can express $D(t)$ as: \n","\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","D(t) = \\min_{i = i,...,k} \\{c_it + d_i\\}\n","\\end{aligned}\n","\n","---------\n","\n","Lets start defining our model now!\n","\n","First lets define our decision variable $t_i$ as the number of minutes player $i$ will play in the game. We want to $\\max C_i(t_i)$ or $D_i(t_i)$ for each player depending on the sign of their $\\beta$ value. Lets define the players with a positive $\\beta$ as belonging to the set $P$ and those with negative $\\beta$ as belonging to the set $N$. This results in the following objective function: $ \\max \\left( \\sum_{i \\in P} C_i(t_i) + \\sum_{i \\in N} D_i(t_i) \\right)$. Exploiting the concave piece-wise form of these functions, we can transform $C_i(t_i)$ and $D_i(t_i)$ so the objective function becomes: \n","\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","\\max \\left( \\sum_{i \\in P} \\min_{k=1,2,3,4} (m^k_it_i + b^k_i) + \\sum_{i \\in N} \\min_{k=1,2,3,4} (c^k_it_i + d^k_i) \\right)\n","\\end{aligned}\n","\n","This current objective function isn't linear yet, so we can't use linear programming as is. However, we can define a new variable $Z_i$ which will capture the APM value for the players with positive $\\beta$ and similarly define $Q_i$ for players with negative $\\beta$. You don't need to understand how this transformation works, but this makes the model linear!. (If you are curious, we can explain it in the lab session). The objective function becomes \n","\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","\\max \\left( \\sum_{i \\in P} Z_i + \\sum_{i \\in N} Q_i \\right)\n","\\end{aligned}\n","\n","and we add the following constraints to \"capture\" the correct objective value:\n","\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","Z_i \\leq (m^k_it_i + b^k_i) \\quad \\forall i \\in P,k \\\\\n","Q_i \\leq (c^k_it_i + d^k_i) \\quad \\forall i \\in N,k \\\\\n","\\end{aligned}\n","\n","Lastly, we need constraints to keep $t$ nonnegative. We also need a constraint to ensure a player doesn't play for more time than the entire game ($32$ minutes). Lastly, the sum of all the playing times need to equal $128$, since there will always be $4$ players on the court, and $4*32 = 128$. Therefore, we add the following constraints:\n","\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","t_i \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall i  \\\\\n","t_i \\leq 32 \\quad \\forall i  \\\\\n","\\sum_{i} t_i = 128 \\\\\n","\\end{aligned}\n","\n","\n","Putting it all together, we have the following **linear** program:\n","\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","        \\max & \\left( \\sum_{i \\in P} Z_i + \\sum_{i \\in N} Q_i \\right) \\\\\n","        s.t. \\quad & Z_i \\leq (m^k_it_i + d^k_i) \\quad \\forall i \\in P,k \\\\\n","        & Q_i \\leq (c^k_it_i + d^k_i) \\quad \\forall i \\in N,k \\\\\n","        & t_i \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall i \\\\\n","        & t_i \\leq 32 \\quad \\forall i \\\\\n","        & \\sum_{i} t_i = 128\\\\\n","\\end{aligned}\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lidITpamgqzd"},"source":["## LP Model: Optimal Play Time Allocation (Coding)\n","\n","Lets now code up this model!
