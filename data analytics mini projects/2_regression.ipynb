They are used to model the relationship between a _target_ variable (i.e., dependent variable) and one or more _features_ (i.e., independent variables). The application of these methods typically falls into one of two categories based on the end goal:\n","\n"," 1. __Prediction:__ estimate the target based on given features. The goal is to obtain a model that performs well on out-of-sample data (i.e., data it hasn't seen before).\n","\n"," 2. __Inference or Information extraction:__ reveal how the target is associated with the feature variables. Care is needed with respect to model assumptions when seeking to extract information.\n","\n","__By the end of this lab you will be able to:__\n","> i) Apply linear regression to *extract information* from a continuous target.  \n","> ii) Apply logistic regression to *predict* a binary target.  \n","> iii) Apply feature selection and regularization to construct better models.  \n","> iv) Evaluate model fitness using $R^2$, mean accuracy, precision-recall, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2BgKbVT1UNzF"},"source":["# Application\n","\n","In this lab, we will use data from the National Basketball League (NBA).

To reduce overfitting, we used our domain knowledge to remove features from the model using a process called _manual feature selection_. If we have a poor understanding of the problem domain and/or we suspect our model is overfitting then doing manual feature selection is difficult. \n","\n","A more automated way to reduce overfitting that requires no domain knowledge is _regularization_. This technique is especially useful in applications with a _relatively large_ number of features ($K$) compared to the number of samples ($n$) in the training dataset. A __very rough__ rule of thumb is that you should have no more than $\\sqrt n$ features in your model (i.e., $K\\le\\sqrt n$). Regularization is a very general operation that can be applied to most models. In this section, we'll explain regularization in the context of linear regression.\n","\n","In regularized linear regression, we add the term $\\frac{1}{C}\\sum_{k=1}^K |\\beta_k|^p$ to the objective of Equation (1), where $p$ is a number that denotes the type of regularization (e.g., L1, L2) and $C$ is a parameter learned by the model (or occasionally selected by the user). The value $\\frac{1}{C}$ is called the _strength of regularization_ (a low value of C corresponds to a high regularization stength). Intuitively, you can think of regularization as a process that penalizes non-zero regression coefficients (i.e., $\\beta > 0$), but keep in mind that different types of regularization produce different results. There are two common types of regularization:\n","\n"," 1. __L1-regularization ($p=1$):__ Also called _LASSO_ regression, is frequently used for feature selection because it implicitly produces a sparse solution, i.e., only a small portion of the regression coefficients will be non-zero.

Cross-validation is performed in $m$ rounds (or $m$-folds, typically called $m$-fold cross validation - more on that in Lab 3). In each round the training set is split into two subsets (1) a subset that the model is trained on, and (2) a subset that the model is evaluated on. After the $m$ rounds are complete, an aggregate measure of performance (e.g., average score) is used to measure model performance. \n","\n","We can use cross validation to search for the best parameter out of a list. For example, we could look for the best parameter $C$ for a regression model out of the list [0.1, 1, 10, 100].

A correctly classified point is a true positive (TP) or true negative (TN) when a value of $1$ or $0$ is correctly predicted, respectively.

The default threshold in scikit-learn is 0.5, but it is a good idea to examine the raw probabilities to see if a better threshold exists.\n","\n","The tool that is most used to help choose a threshold is a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is a plot of true positive rate (TPR) versus false positive rate (FPR) for different threshold values. It is used in a lot in applications where it is important to make sure that there are very few false positives (i.e., false alarms) or very few false negatives (i.e., missed detections).\n","\n","In this section you will plot ROC curves for the three logistic regression models that we built (i.e., `logreg`, `logregl1`, `logregcv`). The [`roc_curve()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_curve.html) function in `sklearn` makes it easy to generate the data for an ROC curve plot. As input, this function takes the ground truth target label and the model's estimated probability of \"1\", which is generated by the [`predict_proba()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.predict_proba) method.
